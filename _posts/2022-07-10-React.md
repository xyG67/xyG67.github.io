# React

## Running react application

run the command below, then it would open a browser automatically with the URL http://localhost:3000/

```
npm start
```

## Building react application

The original code wouldn't be feasible to deploy due to its size. It would take a lot of time to render on the client side. To deploy the application, we would require the code to be minified to reduce the download times on the client's browser. 

Generate a build folder in the project directory. You can deploy the contents of the build folder to any web server. 

```
npm run build
```
